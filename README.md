# Home Buying DAO
 
Deployed a custom ERC-20 token. Deployed a ERC-1155 NFT so people can mint to join my Home Buying DAO. Deployed a governance contract and treasury. Built a dApp that lets people connect their wallet, get a NFT, see a DAO Dashboard where they can see other members' in the DAO and vote on proposals that are executed directly by the governance contract created for the DAO.

Technologies used: Hyperledger, ThirdWeb, Alchemy, ERC-1155, Rinkeby testnet, IPFS, ERC-20, ERC-1155, MetaMask, React, HTML, CSS
